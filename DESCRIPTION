Description: Processes multiple files with a user-supplied function. The
    key design principle is that only files which were last modified
    before the directory was configured are processed.  A hidden file
    stores the configuration time and function etc while successfully
    processed files are automatically touched to update their modification
    date. As a result batch processing can be stopped and restarted and
    any files created (or modified or deleted) during processing are
    ignored.
